Make an NPC that has a queue of commands (patrols certain zones, inspects certain areas, etc.)
There are a couple of locations that the enemy will stop to investigate, represented by some cubes (imagine them as treasure chests).
Within the cubes, there are a couple that hold treasure. When the enemy finds treasure cubes, he colors them a different color.
The user can click on the cubes and make the npc move towards them. Once the NPC reaches them, he starts investigating.
