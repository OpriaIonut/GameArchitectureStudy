Make a map that has multiple items spawned randomly.
When you get close to an item, if you press a key, you will collect it and it will get added to the inventory (it will stack the items)
In the inventory you can select an item and can do the following actions:
	-split stack -> take one item from the stack (option doesn't appear if it is a single item)
	-use -> uses the item (don't really care what it does, some simple logs are enough)
	-drop -> discard the item and put it back on the map at the player's position)
