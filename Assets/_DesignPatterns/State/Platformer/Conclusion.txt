It is an interesting way of programming, encapsulate into states the specific behavior of characters and change between them based on desired logic.

There are some issues to be faced that coul dmake this pattern counter-productive. For example, to add jumping, I had to modify both Idle and Moving states to add them knowledge for "is the player grounded", in order to transition to the Jumping state. For what it's fair, I only had to change the states that could trigger the Jumping state, but it still breaks the Open-Closed Principle.

It's also tricky to use if you want to add competing states (ex: dash-attack combo, or jumping-kick combo).

Honestly I don't see that many uses for this pattern, outside of node-based systems and AI.
